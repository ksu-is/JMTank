# JMTank Description and Instructions

This is a simple Tank Game written in Python and implemented with Pygame.

You control the green tank (player) and fight against the red tank (computer).

* The UP and DOWN keys control the angle of your cannon.
* Press LEFT-CTRL or LEFT-ALT to change the power level of the shoot.
* The SPACE key will launch the cannonball.
* The LEFT and RIGHT keys help you to move your tank to the left and right.

The health value associated with your tank is shown with the green gauge. The health value of the
computer's tank is shown with red gauge. The aim is to decrease the
computer's health to zero and keep yours above zero.

Avoid of falling too much since falling may decrease your energy level.
